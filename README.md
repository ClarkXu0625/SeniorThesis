- algorithm folder contains implementation of xcs (accuracy-based learning classifier system)
- classifier_neuRecommend folder loads hand-labeled data and includes pre-trained model from Abu (https://github.com/abuzarmahmood/neuRecommend)
- Network folder simulates a large Hodgkinâ€“Huxley model to produce a network's spike train. Simulating extracellular data requires the spike train to produce faked waveform data and labels.
- extracellular_data folder simulates of 'faked' extracellular data with determined ground truth
