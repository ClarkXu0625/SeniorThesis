# SeniorThesis
 
Senior thesis project for NEUR99

- algorithm folder contains implementation of xcs (accuracy-based learning classifier system)
- classifier_neuRecommend folder loads hand-labeled data and includes pre-trained model from Abu, https://github.com/abuzarmahmood/neuRecommend
- Network folder simulates a large Hodgkinâ€“Huxley model to produce a network's spike train. Simulating extracellular data requires the spike train to produce faked waveform data and labels. Network parameter from paper by Giannari and Astolfi (2022), https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1016/j.neucom.2022.04.115
- extracellular_data folder simulates of 'faked' extracellular data with determined ground truth
